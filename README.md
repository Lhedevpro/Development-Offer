# 🚀 End-to-End Web3 Solutions: dApp & Smart Contract Development

## Why choose a custom dApp? ⚙️

Your Web3 vision deserves a decentralized application (dApp) that stands out. As a fullstack developer specialized in Web3, I design and develop **complete dApps** and **custom smart contracts** — from intuitive user interface to robust on-chain logic.  
No more generic solutions: every line of code is crafted to **serve your project, your universe, your goals**.

## Who am I? 🧠

I'm **Loïc**, a **fullstack developer specialized in Web3**.  
Self-taught, rigorous, passionate about **gamification** and engagement mechanics, I handle the entire stack:

- Front-end (React + Tailwind)
- Smart contracts (Solidity)
- API / Backend (Node.js, Hardhat, ethers.js)

*(Top 250 Node Guardians)*

Every project is a **strategic and technical** playground for me.  
I code cleanly, test thoroughly, and deliver what I promise.
